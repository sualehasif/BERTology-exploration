suggestion	O
is	O
that	O
you	O

the	O

it	O

complete	O
with	O
a	O
quaint	B-OP

good	B-OP

I	O
find	O
that	O
most	O
Kosher	O

to	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
has	O
been	O
the	O

The	O

can	O
not	O
complain	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
wait	B-ASP
for	O
a	O

Although	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
10-15	O
minutes	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
more	O

45	O
minutes	O

We	O
were	O
ushered	O

Our	O

I	O

I	O

or	O
flavor	O

I	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
expensive	O
and	O
I	O
prefer	O
Bella	O
Via	O
just	O
blocks	O
away	O
by	O

So	O
rude	O
!!!	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
JWILS	O
.	O

Her	O
review	O
is	O
above	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
went	O
for	O
this	O
horrible	O
experience	O
.	O

My	O
friend	O
is	O
100	O
%	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
experience	O
we	O
had	O
.	O

The	O
hostess	B-ASP
was	O
rude	B-OP
and	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
distinct	O
feeling	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
serve	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
my	O
friend	O
left	O
out	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
the	O
bartender	B-ASP
disappeared	B-OP
.	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
menu	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
waitress	B-ASP
looked	O
at	O
my	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
insane	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
shocked	O
that	O
my	O
friends	O
wanted	O
to	O
stay	O
after	O
the	O
waitress	B-ASP
said	O
,	O
"	O
can	O
I	O
help	O
you	O
"	O
and	O
"	O
how	O
many	O
are	O
in	O
your	O
party	O
.	O
"	O

What	O
?	O

The	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
standing	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
her	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
indication	O
of	O
how	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
there	O
were	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
n't	O
look	O
like	O
the	O
other	O
patrons	O
in	O
there	O
so	O
unfortunately	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O
.	O

Shame	B-OP
on	O
this	O
place	O
for	O
the	O
horrible	B-OP
rude	B-OP
staff	B-ASP
and	O
non-existent	B-OP
customer	B-ASP
service	I-ASP
.	O

bad	B-OP
staff	B-ASP

I	O
generally	O
like	B-OP
this	O
place	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
good	B-OP
.	O

The	O
design	O
of	O
the	O
space	B-ASP
is	O
good	B-OP
.	O

But	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
is	O
HORRID	B-OP
!	O

I	O
was	O
there	O
for	O
brunch	O
recently	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
tag	O
teamed	B-OP
by	O
a	O
waitress	B-ASP
and	O
a	O
waiter	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
waiter	B-ASP
delivered	O
our	O
food	O
while	O
holding	O
what	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
plastic	O
bag	O
of	O
garbage	O
in	O
one	O
hand	O
.	O

I	O
ca	O
n't	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
but	O
please	O
put	O
the	O
bag	O
down	O
before	O
delivering	O
food	O
!	O

The	O
waitress	B-ASP
came	O
to	O
check	O
in	O
on	O
us	O
every	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
plates	O
while	O
half	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
still	O
eating	O
(	O
a	O
big	O
pet	O
peeve	O
of	O
mine	O
that	O
happens	O
almost	O
everywhere	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
try	O
to	O
ignore	O
it	O
)	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
n't	O
ignore	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
reach	O
over	O
the	O
plate	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
in	O
mid	O
bite	O
,	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
table	O
.	O

She	O
then	O
put	O
the	O
check	O
down	O
without	O
asking	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
check	O
on	O
the	O
bill	O
every	O
two	O
minutes	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
one	O
of	O
three	O
occupied	O
tables	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
could	O
like	O
this	O
place	B-ASP
more	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
someone	O
would	O
retrain	O
the	O
staff	B-ASP
